# Testing Agda Cubical

An attempt to translate statements from abstract algebra into [Agda](https://github.com/agda/agda), using the [Cubical](https://github.com/agda/cubical) library.

Agda is a dependently-typed programming language with Haskell-like syntax, which can be used as a proof assistant.

Cubical is an implementation of cubical type theory as described in the eponymous paper by Cyril Cohen, Thierry Coquand, Simon Huber, Anders MÃ¶rtberg, often referred to as CCHM.
